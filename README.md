# BMI-Calculator
A simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input their height and weight to calculate their BMI and receive a health classification (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obesity). This project demonstrates basic web development skills and interactive JavaScript functionality.
